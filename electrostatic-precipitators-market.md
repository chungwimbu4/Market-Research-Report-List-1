<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrostatic Precipitators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Electrostatic Precipitators</li><li>Wet Electrostatic Precipitators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electrostatic precipitator market comprises two main types: dry and wet electrostatic precipitators. Dry electrostatic precipitators utilize high-voltage electrostatic fields to remove particulate matter from industrial emissions without water, making them effective for dry particles. Wet electrostatic precipitators, on the other hand, employ water or other liquids to capture both particulate and gaseous pollutants, facilitating removal in humid environments. Each type serves specific applications, with dry units favored for low moisture processes while wet units target more versatile pollutant scenarios.</p></p>
